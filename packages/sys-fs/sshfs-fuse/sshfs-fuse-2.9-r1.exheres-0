SUMMARY="FUSE filesystem client to access remote filesystems via SSH"
DESCRIPTION="
This is a FUSE filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol. Since most SSH servers
already support this protocol it is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there is nothing
to do. On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with SSH.

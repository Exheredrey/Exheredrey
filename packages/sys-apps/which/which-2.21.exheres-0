SUMMARY="Utility showing the full path of commands"
DESCRIPTION="
Which takes one or more arguments. For each of its arguments it prints to stdout the full path of
the executables that would have been executed when this argument had been entered at the shell
prompt. It does this by searching for an executable or script in the directories listed in the
environment variable PATH using the same algorithm as bash.

SUMMARY="Asynchronous input/output library that uses the kernels native interface"
DESCRIPTION="
AIO enables even a single application thread to overlap I/O operations with other
processing, by providing an interface for submitting one or more I/O requests in
one system call (io_submit()) without waiting for completion, and a separate interface
(io_getevents()) to reap completed I/O operations associated with a given completion
group. Support for kernel AIO has been included in the 2.6 Linux kernel.

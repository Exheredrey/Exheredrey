SUMMARY="Numerical abstraction library"
DESCRIPTION="
The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions especially targeted at
applications in the field of analysis and verification of complex systems. These abstractions
include convex polyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open or closed)
halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict or non-strict) with rational coefficients;
some special classes of polyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs; and
grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of linear congruence relations. The
library also supports finite powersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids, a mixed
integer linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic version of the simplex
algorithm, a parametric integer programming solver, and primitives for termination analysis via the
automatic synthesis of linear ranking functions.

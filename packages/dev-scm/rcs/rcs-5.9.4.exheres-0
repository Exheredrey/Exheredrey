SUMMARY="RCS - Revision Control System"
DESCRIPTION="
The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of files. RCS
automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification, and merging of
revisions. RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently, e. g. programs,
documentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.
You don't want to use this unless it's a dependency for something you really need.

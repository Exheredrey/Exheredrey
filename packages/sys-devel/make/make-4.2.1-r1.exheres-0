SUMMARY="GNU tool which simplifies the build process for users"
DESCRIPTION="
Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program
from the program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other
files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use
Make to build and install the program.

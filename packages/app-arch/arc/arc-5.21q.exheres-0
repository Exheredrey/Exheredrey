SUMMARY="Tool to manage archives in the .arc format"
DESCRIPTION="
This is a port of SEA arc which is a general archive and file compression utility,
used to maintain a compressed archive of files. It creates, modifies, and extracts
from .arc files using the old Crunch, Squash, and Squeeze compression methods for
each file within the archive, based on whichever method yields the smallest result.
Arc runs on most Unix/POSIX systems as well as mainframes and other microcomputers.
ARC is an old format that's rarely used nowadays but you may still encounter .arc
format archives, e. g. in FidoNet.

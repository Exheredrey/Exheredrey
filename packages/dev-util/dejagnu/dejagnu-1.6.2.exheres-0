SUMMARY="Framework for testing other programs"
DESCRIPTION="
DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its purpose is to provide a single front end for
all tests. Think of it as a custom library of Tcl procedures crafted to support writing a test
harness. A test harness is the testing infrastructure that is created to support a specific program
or tool. Each program can have multiple testsuites, all supported by a single test harness. DejaGnu
is written in Expect, which in turn uses Tcl -- Tool command language.

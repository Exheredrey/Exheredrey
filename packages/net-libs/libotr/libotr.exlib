SUMMARY="Off-The-Record Messaging library and toolkit"
DESCRIPTION="
Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations over instant messaging by providing:
* Encryption: No one else can read your instant messages.
* Authentication: You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
* Deniability: The messages you send do not have digital signatures that are checkable by a third party.
  Anyone can forge messages after a conversation to make them look like they came from you.
  However, during a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages he sees are authentic and unmodified.
* Perfect forward secrecy: If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.

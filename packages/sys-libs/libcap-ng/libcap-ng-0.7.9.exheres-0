SUMMARY="Advanced POSIX 1003.1e capabilities library and tools"
DESCRIPTION="
The libcap-ng library is intended to make programming with POSIX capabilities
much easier than the traditional libcap library. It includes utilities that can
analyse all currently running applications and print out any capabilities and
whether or not it has an open ended bounding set. An open bounding set without
the securebits \"NOROOT\" flag will allow full capabilities escalation for apps
retaining UID 0 simply by calling 'execve'.

SUMMARY="High-Level Interface to Uniforum Message Translation"
DESCRIPTION="
libintl-perl provides Uniforum message translation for Perl. It is the de-facto
standard for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of software
written in Perl. Its main features are:
  * both a one-to-one port of the GNU gettext runtime library in Perl
    (Locale::Messages) and a perlish interface (Locale::TextDomain) that mimics
    the common _() C preprocessor macro flavored with Perl
  * transparent charset conversion and UTF-8 support for all perl versions
    including 5.004
  * utility functions for locale settings in server applications
  * extensive documentation including a sample application
